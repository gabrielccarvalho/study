# Study

## Description
This application was built as an alternative to platforms like 'GymRats' to track in a gamified way your progress
in your studies. <br />
To achieve that I've used NextJS, with Firebase and Clerk.

## Installation
Installing and running the project is pretty straight forward:

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
    git clone <repository>
    cd <repository>
   ```

2. Install the dependencies
   ```bash
    pnpm install
   ```

3. Run the project
   ```bash
    pnpm run dev
   ```

## How to use it
You only need to create an account / log in with social media, create a 'Challenge' and invite friends to join.

# Media
